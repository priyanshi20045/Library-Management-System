# 📚 Library Management System

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Library Management System** is a simple **console-based C++ application** designed to perform essential library operations such as adding, searching, issuing, and returning books. It demonstrates the use of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts, **file handling**, and **menu-driven programming** in C++.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Implement **Object-Oriented Programming** principles in C++.
- Practice **file handling** techniques for storing and retrieving data.
- Design a **menu-driven interface** for user interaction.
- Improve **modular programming** and code organization skills.

## 🛠️ Features
- Add new book records
- Search books by ID or name
- Display all available books
- Issue and return books
- Delete book records
- Simple file storage (if implemented)

## 💻 Technologies Used
- **Language:** C++
- **Compiler:** g++ / MinGW / Code::Blocks
- **Platform:** Windows / Linux
- **Tools:** VS Code / Code::Blocks / Dev-C++

💡 Future Enhancements
Integrate a Graphical User Interface (GUI) using Qt or JavaFX.

Add database support (MySQL/SQLite) for better data management.

Implement user authentication.

Use advanced data structures (linked lists, trees).

Convert into a web-based application using Flask/Django.
